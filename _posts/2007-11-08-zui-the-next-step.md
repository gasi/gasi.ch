Yesterday I talked a little bit about zooming user interfaces. Today I came
across this jaw-dropping video of Jeff Han’s Perceptive Pixels Multitouch
Display. It perfectly demonstrates what experience is possible if we put
together multitouch technology with zoomable user interfaces.

Enough talked. See for yourself:

My vision for [tandem][] is much more humble. It is about improving the
experience for exploring Flickr. Part of that is harnessing the power of
zoomable user interfaces. Another  part, that I haven’t talked about yet,
are filtering & layouting  techniques that enable us to digest information in
a more intuitive way. What I am really trying to do is bring together the
concepts others have explored  before me and apply them to Flickr. It's as
simple as that. In the spirit of Sir Isaac Newton:

> If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.

P.S. Today I’ve got my [first comment][1] (that is not spam) on this blog.
Besides that, it is an  interesting one, too. I am glad that I am not the only
one being fascinated by  the potential of ZUI. Franklin Servan-Schreiber of
[Zoomorama][] is also  working on bringing zooming to the web. To get an idea
of what he’s up  to, check out [this introductory blog post][zoomorama-intro]
and [this beautiful example][zoomorama-example] of his work. Thanks, Franklin.
