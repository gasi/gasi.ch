title: Hello, tandem.

I&#x27;ve been thinking &amp; writing <a href="/blog/zui-the-next-step/">a</a> <a href="/blog/zooming-in-flash-flex/">lot</a> <a href="/blog/deep-zoom-microsofts-take-on-bringing-zooming-to-the-web/">about</a> <a href="/blog/zoomable-user-interfaces/">Zoomable User Interfaces</a> and now and then I mentioned <a href="/blog/tandem/">tandem</a>, the project I&#x27;ve been working on&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;off, exploring the different concepts behind ZUIs.

Well, finally, after the last few weeks of hard work <em>(and a lot of fun)</em>, I&#x27;d like to present you on where I am today:

<em>Try it out for yourself at <a href="http://tandem.gasi.ch/">http://tandem.gasi.ch/</a></em>

<h2>RTFM</h2>
<a href="http://tandem.gasi.ch/">tandem</a> is very easy to use. Simply use your mouse wheel to zoom in and out on the photos and click &amp; drag to move around. However, in my opinion, there&#x27;s even a cooler way to zoom around and that is by using your keyboard. Be sure to click inside your browser first and then use the <strong>arrow keys</strong> or <strong>W</strong>, <strong>A</strong>, <strong>S</strong>, <strong>D</strong> to move around and the <strong>+</strong> &amp; <strong>&ndash;</strong> keys on your Numpad or alternatively <strong>I</strong> &amp; <strong>O</strong> to zoom in and out. And yeah, if this is to slow for you, simply hold down the <strong>Shift</strong> key while pressing the other keys. Dive in to see a photo in better quality and if you like it, an innocent double click will take you to the original on <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a> so you can manifest your appreciation for the photo and the artist in a comment.

<h2>You</h2>
Although I love <a href="http://tandem.gasi.ch/">tandem</a>, it is really <em>not</em> about me. If you have a <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a> account (otherwise hurry up and <a href="http://flickr.com/signup/">get one</a>), <em>you</em> can use <a href="http://tandem.gasi.ch/">tandem</a> to explore <em>your own</em> photos in a new way . Simply type <a href="http://tandem.gasi.ch/#/">http://tandem.gasi.ch/#/</a> and then add your personal Flickr address to view your own photos. For example, my personal address is either <a href="http://tandem.gasi.ch/#/photos/72389028@N00/">http://tandem.gasi.ch/#/photos/72389028@N00/</a> or the much nicer shortcut <a href="http://tandem.gasi.ch/#/gasi/">http://tandem.gasi.ch/#/gasi/</a>.

<h2>Open</h2>
To me, personally, <a href="http://tandem.gasi.ch/">tandem</a> is much more than a fun way to browse through photos. Since I started exploring this idea almost a year ago &mdash; <em>can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s been so long</em> &mdash; I have learned a lot and I mean <em>a lot</em>. Two complete rewrites later, namely <a href="http://tandem.gasi.ch/1">this</a> and <a href="http://tandem.gasi.ch/">that one</a>, I have come to a point where I am more or less happy with the architectural foundation of the application &mdash; <em>which is more than an aspiring Computer Scientist could ask for</em> &mdash; and therefore I am making <a href="http://tandem.gasi.ch/">tandem</a> <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tandem/">open source</a> as of today.

I&#x27;ve made this decision early on when I saw my fascination for ZUIs grow stronger from day to day. It means several things to me. First, giving back to the community I&#x27;ve learned so much from, by giving interested individuals a view behind the scenes of how I approach development and to show that Flash applications aren&#x27;t <a href="http://www.onflex.org/ted/2008/05/adobe-walled-garden-of-knowledge.php">dark magic</a>. Second, this is a longer-term commitment to the ideas behind this project. Where I am spending my summer has a lot to do with this, although believe me when I tell you that this deserves at least another whole post for itself. Third, it&#x27;s my first step into the fascinating world of open source development.

<h2>Roadmap</h2>
What you <a href="http://tandem.gasi.ch/">see today</a> is not the end, it&#x27;s just the beginning. I have a lot of ideas that I want to see realized in <a href="http://tandem.gasi.ch/">tandem</a> that, at the moment, are only sketches on paper lying around all over my room. Besides that, there&#x27;s obviously a lot to fix around memory management <em>(I know, I am quite bad at cleaning up after myself)</em> as well as replacing all my favorite na&iuml;ve implementations of certain algorithms &amp; data structures. <em>Sorry, <a href="http://www.ti.inf.ethz.ch/people/widmayer.html">Prof. Dr. Widmayer</a>.</em>

<h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
Like I said, the application is <a href="http://tandem.gasi.ch/">online</a>, spread the word and let me know what you think. Then, the entire source code is available at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tandem/">http://code.google.com/p/tandem/</a> under the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">GNU Affero General Public License Version 3</a> or at <a href="http://tandem.gasi.ch/source/">http://tandem.gasi.ch/source/</a> if you bother <em>checking it out</em>.
<em>Enjoy.</em>

<em><strong>Attention:</strong> If you appreciate the kind of experiences that <a href="http://tandem.gasi.ch/">tandem</a> and other Flash applications offer, please take a minute to <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=434914">vote on this bug</a> in the upcoming Firefox 3 that basically cripples keyboard support in Flash. Thanks.</em>
