So far, the response to the first release of <a href="http://tandem.gasi.ch/">tandem</a> has been <a href="http://www.zoomoblog.com/zooming/2008/05/a-killer-piece.html">very</a> <a href="http://fr.techcrunch.com/2008/05/30/fr-tandem-une-superbe-interface-pour-naviguer-sur-flickr/">positive</a> and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Besides that, there are thousands of ideas spinning around in my head, waiting to be realized. In between bug fixing and prototyping new features, I love to play around with some of <a href="http://tandem.gasi.ch/">tandem&#x27;s</a> various parameters.

Obviously, software in the real world is built around certain constraints. In <a href="http://tandem.gasi.ch/">tandem</a>, one of these constraints is, <em>at the moment at least</em>, the number of photos that can be displayed on screen. For the current release, I&#x27;ve came to limit this number to around three hundred &mdash; 363 to be precise.  This is due to the fact that I haven&#x27;t invested much time into memory management yet, a matter that turned out to be <a href="http://www.gskinner.com/blog/archives/2008/04/failure_to_unlo.html">one of Flash Player 9&#x27;s dirty little secrets</a>.

Anyway, the real test for <a href="http://tandem.gasi.ch/">tandem</a>, to a certain point for selfish reasons, will always be <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/gasi">my personal Flickr account</a> which currently features <strong>6250 public photos</strong>. Needless to say, nobody who&#x27;s right in his mind would attempt to load <em>6250 photos</em> into a Flash application, would she? Well, whatever you may think, I did. And, it was a lot of fun. However, see for yourself:

By the way, this fun little experiment only used up little more than 1.2&nbsp;GB of memory. Gotta love this little quote by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Northcote_Parkinson">Parkinson</a>:
<q>Software expands to fill the available memory.</q>

<em><strong>P.S.</strong> Since <a href="/blog/hello-tandem/#comments">someone asked already</a>, the closest to setting up a feed for releases, was setting up a <strong>tandem commits mailing list</strong> at <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/tandem-commits">http://groups.google.com/group/tandem-commits</a>.</em>
