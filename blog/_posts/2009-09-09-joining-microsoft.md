title: Joining Microsoft
---
I am thrilled to announce that I'll be joining the <a href="http://seadragon.com">Seadragon team</a> at <a href="http://livelabs.com">Microsoft Live Labs</a> as a <em>research intern</em>. Ever since I first watched <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/blaise_aguera_y_arcas_demos_photosynth.html">Blaise Agüera y Arcas present Seadragon &amp; Photosynth</a> at <a href="http://ted.com">TED</a>, I knew the Seadragon team was at the cutting edge of changing the way we will interact with vast amounts of visual information in the future.

## All Good Things Come To An End
I've had a blast and learned a lot during my internship at [Seadragon][].
More importantly, I was fortunate enough to meet and spend time with many great
people whom I dearly miss now.

*The internship ended at the beginning of January and I've returned to
Switzerland in February.*

Getting the chance to be a part of this group of extremely visionary &amp;
talented people is a feeling I cannot describe. I am looking forward to finally
meet some of the people I've had contact with over the last months in person,
among them [Ian](http://twitter.com/iangilman), [Aseem](http://twitter.com/aseemk),
[Ben](http://twitter.com/benvanik), [Kevin](http://twitter.com/mr_yuk), [Lutz](http://blogs.msdn.com/lutzg),
[James](http://twitter.com/modeless), [Bill](http://twitter.com/billcrow),
[Jay](http://twitter.com/jaysenior), and all those I haven't got to know so far.

They are the brilliant minds behind products & projects such as
[Silverlight Deep Zoom][], [Seadragon Ajax][], [Seadragon Mobile][],
[Seadragon.com][], [Photosynth][],
[<strike>WMP</strike> <strike>HD Photo</strike> JPEG XR][JPEG XR],
[Infinite Canvas][], [Gimme Shiny!] and [PSP Player][].

Personally I see working at Microsoft as a great opportunity to work on
[all][ZUIs] [the][tandem-post] [things][openzoom] [I’m][OZI] [passionate][tandem]
[about][gigapan-mobile] and potentially reach millions of people around the world.

Stay tuned as I'll share my stories about settling down in the [Seattle area](seattle-maps)
and hopefully a bit about the stuff I’ll be working on!

Yours,\\
Daniel

### P.S. OpenZoom
As of next week active development of the [OpenZoom SDK][]
on my part will be put on hold for the duration of my internship. I consider the
features and components already included ([0.4.2.1 release][openzoom-sdk-latest])
fairly stable and as many people have shown it's very well suited to be used
in real-world projects. Apart from that, I'll still try my best to answer questions
and help out on the [OpenZoom community](http://www.openzoom.org/go/community)
whenever possible.
{:.footnote}

I'd like to point that I made sure that the status of the
[OpenZoom][] project itself is not in any way affected by this announcement.
It's still open source and free. Actually, I'd like to encourage other people to
[fork it](http://github.com/openzoom/sdk) and continue where I left off.
