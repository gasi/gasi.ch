title: OpenZoom, <br/>Is This Your Luggage?
---
Lately I’ve been working a lot on very technical stuff around [OpenZoom][].
I  desperately needed a break. Then I stumbled upon [Is This Your Luggage][ITYL]
and I instantaneously fell in love with the site. But then I asked myself…

<q>Wouldn’t this be even more awesome using zooming?</q>

Here we are, a couple of hours later. I’ve ripped apart the [original site][ITYL]
and put it together again but this time in a zooming environment.
One nice side-effect has been that I’ve found a couple of rough edges in the
[OpenZoom SDK API][api] that I was able to improve due this quick real-world
check. Alright, enough talked, check it out!

OpenZoom. If you liked this, please give proper respect to the author and

<h3>P.S.</h3>
This is supposed to demonstrate a bit what kind of experiences you can build
with the [OpenZoom SDK][]. It doesn't always have to be high-resolution images
and a boring layout. Hope you enjoy it. ;)
