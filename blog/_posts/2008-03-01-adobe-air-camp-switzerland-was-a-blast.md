title: 'Adobe AIR Camp <br/>Switzerland Was a Blast!'
---
I just got up after 18 hours of sleep.
The reason? The <a href="http://aircamp.ch/">Adobe AIR Camp Switzerland</a>.

About three weeks ago, I got a call from Adobe and was asked if I would like to find out more about Adobe&#x27;s newest addition to the family, namely <a href="http://adobe.com/products/air/">Adobe AIR</a>. The idea was to get the best Swiss web developers together for a two day workshop &amp; contest here in Zurich. I signed up immediately and since I was given the opportunity to bring someone along, I&#x27;ve asked my brilliant college buddy <a href="http://424f.com/">Boris</a> to join me. Although his background is more into heavy-duty C++ programming, he surprisingly agreed to come along.

On Day 1, Thursday, we got an overview of <a href="http://adobe.com/go/air">Adobe AIR</a> by <a href="http://madowney.com/blog/">Mike Downey</a>. He showed us some of the cool applications that have already been built for AIR such as <a href="http://desktop.ebay.com/">eBay Desktop</a>, a <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/showcase/air/nickelodeon.html">Nickelodeon application</a> and an internal Adobe <a href="http://adobe.com/devnet/air/flex/samples.html">employee directory application</a>. Later we had a good introduction to the API new in Adobe AIR by <a href="http://www.webkitchen.be/">Serge Jespers</a>. After that we were given time until Day 2, Friday, 4pm to build a cool application for Adobe AIR.

I worked the 24+ hours &mdash; with about 2 hours of sleep in between &mdash; on the same idea that I&#x27;ve had for quite a while now: exploring <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> in a different way.

The approach I took, given the tight time constraint, was to seriously follow a <acronym title="Rapid Application Development">RAD</acronym> paradigm. Surprisingly, it worked out quite well. The application I&#x27;ve built, called <em>Monad</em>, is by no means anything close to finished or even stable but it succeeds in showing some of my ideas of how Zoomable User Interfaces (<acronym title="Zoomable User Interface">ZUI</acronym>) can improve the way we explore information spaces.

Well, in the end &mdash; to my surprise &mdash; I&#x27;ve won the 4th place in the contest.

Thanks to Adobe for making that event happen!
It was a blast &mdash; the people, the food &amp; the atmosphere were awesome!

Especially, I&#x27;d like to thank <a href="http://424f.com/">Boris</a> for joining me &mdash; it wouldn&#x27;t have been half the fun without him! I am very proud of him, as he built an impressive RSS reader called <em>AirReader</em> based on the (still unreleased) <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/2005/12/google-reader-api.html">Google Reader API</a> using some cool tricks for authentication while having never before touched ActionScript or Flex Builder.

Well, the following are some screenshots of <em>Monad</em> &amp; <em>AirReader</em>&#8230;

It&#x27;s cool to see the logo of your application on the desktop among all the other &laquo;real&raquo; applications &ndash; thanks to Adobe AIR!
