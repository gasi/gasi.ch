Ever since <a href="http://livelabs.com/">Microsoft Live Labs</a> released <a href="http://photosynth.net/">Photosynth</a>, I wanted to give this revolutionary technology a shot with <a href="http://photosynth.net/view.aspx?cid=F5735DFE-4D28-41FB-B6FA-CFF7775B9C46">my own photos.</a> Due to the tremendous popularity of the site, it took me four attempts to successfully publish <a href="http://photosynth.net/view.aspx?cid=F5735DFE-4D28-41FB-B6FA-CFF7775B9C46">my &laquo;synth.&raquo;</a> The <a href="http://photosynth.net/view.aspx?cid=F5735DFE-4D28-41FB-B6FA-CFF7775B9C46">&laquo;synth&raquo;</a> below represents the courtyard of the <a href="http://www.mairie20.paris.fr/mairie20/jsp/site/Portal.jsp?page_id=549">incubator</a> that our company <a href="http://zoomorama.com/">Zoomorama</a> is part of. I am pretty happy with the way it turned my 213 photos (515MB image date) into a 94% &laquo;synthy&raquo; collage:

Other than this, I hope that soon I&#x27;ll be able to talk about the exciting things I&#x27;ve been working on during this summer at <a href="http://zoomorama.com/">Zoomorama</a>. Stay tuned.
